# 🚀 Node.js Full-Course Project  
Welcome to my codebase created while following the **“Node.js Full Course for Beginners | Complete All-in-One Tutorial”** on YouTube.  
*(Link to the tutorial: https://youtu.be/f2EqECiTBL8?si=oWZM6F4tFgsaQMxq)*

## 📁 What’s Inside  
This project covers the full spectrum of a beginner-to-intermediate Node.js workflow:  
- 📌 Setup of a basic Node.js server  
- 🔄 Routing, middleware & error handling  
- 📦 Working with files (read, write, logs)  
- 🗄️ Data storage techniques (simple JSON, file-based)  
- 🔧 Practical utilities and helpers (logging, custom middleware)  
- 🧪 All code written live along with the tutorial track

## 👍 Why This Project Matters

This isn’t just “hello world” — I built the project end-to-end while pausing, tweaking and exploring extra features.

* I reinforced core Node.js fundamentals.
* I got hands-on with file I/O, middleware and server structure.
* I built something that’s **fork-ready** so you can clone and extend.

## 🧭 Structure at a Glance

```
/src
  /middleware     → custom middleware modules  
  /routes         → route handlers  
  /utils          → logging, helpers  
  server.js       → entry-point  
/logs             → runtime log files  
package.json      → project configuration  
```

## 💡 Inspired by

This repo is 100% derived from the YouTube tutorial mentioned above, but with **my own enhancements**:

* better file structure
* extended error logging
* added comments for clarity
  Feel free to **fork** it and build your own version.
